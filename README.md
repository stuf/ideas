# Ideas for Stuff To Do™

This repository will contain a bunch of ideas for all kinds of Stuff™ that I might think of every now and then. The purpose for this is just to get some place to write them down, as well as someone stumbling upon this repository in search of something to do.

If and when these ideas grow into a repository of their own, I'll (try to remember to) link the repository here as well.
